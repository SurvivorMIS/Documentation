#SurvivorMIS Use Cases

##History  
The SurvivorMIS was built by the [Friends of Maiti Nepal](http://friendsofmaitinepal.org) team in partnership with [Maiti Nepal](http://www.maitinepal.org). Maiti Nepal is a grassroots organization that combats human trafficking of women and children. The SurvivorMIS was first built to meet Maiti Nepal's daily operational needs. However, the organization decided to build the SurvivorMIS n an open way so that all organizations that combat human trafficking can use a common set of terminology and tools.

##Intended Audience  
The SurvivorMIS is built to be run at the point of care. In plain English, the system is used where the survivor is being served which is most often in an office or clinic setting. Version 1 of the SurvivorMIS is intended to be accessed through a laptop or desktop computer. Version 2 will focus on moving from the office to the field by integrating with mobile data collection tools. The software is available for download and implementation by any organization working in this space. Please [contact us](http://survivormis.com/#contact) if you are interested in running your own implementation or contributing to the SurvivorMIS.
