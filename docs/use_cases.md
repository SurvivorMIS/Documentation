#SurvivorMIS Use Cases

##History  
The SurvivorMIS was built by the [Friends of Maiti Nepal](http://friendsofmaitinepal.org) team in partnership with [Maiti Nepal](http://www.maitinepal.org). Maiti Nepal is a grassroots organization that combats human trafficking of women and children. The SurvivorMIS was first built to meet Maiti Nepal's daily operational needs. However, the organization decided to build the SurvivorMIS n an open way so that all organizations that combat human trafficking can use a common set of terminology and tools.

##Problem Definition  
Organizations that combat human trafficking have a need to collect evidence and actionable information from the first interaction with a survivor until the moment they exit from care. The SurvivorMIS is structured to standardize and ease the information collection process for grassroots organizations working in this field. The SurvivorMIS allows functional groups to interact with the system. Each functional group has a different set of technical and informational needs as described in the following table. We define **the field** as a group of team members who are deployed for a short period, one day or less, to a location where they work in the community. **Satellite offices** are field locations that temporarily house survivors and begin providing primary services from the anti-trafficking organization. Note that not all organizations have satellite offices, but the flexibility remains in the system. Some teams deploy to the field from the central office. For example, a rescue team may deploy to the field to rescue victims from an exploitative situation. The central office is the location where the majority of services are delivered as well as the location where major organizational departments are housed. This is likely the location with the core management and ICT infrastructure. Finally we define external audiences as groups who do not have direct interaction with the client but require aggregate information.  

The following table describes the technical and informational needs of each functional group:

##Intended Audience  
The SurvivorMIS is built to be run at the point of care. In plain English, the system is used where the survivor is being served which is most often in an office or clinic setting. Version 1 of the SurvivorMIS is intended to be accessed through a laptop or desktop computer. Version 2 will focus on moving from the office to the field by integrating with mobile data collection tools. The software is available for download and implementation by any organization working in this space. Please [contact us](http://survivormis.com/#contact) if you are interested in running your own implementation or contributing to the SurvivorMIS.




##Use Case  
Shreya Shrestha created the foundation for the following use case descriptions in a consultancy in 2014. These use cases describe the flow of individuals at one of the offices. This section contains a high level overview with specific details and graphics below.
