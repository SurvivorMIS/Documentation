#Technical Roadmap  

##v 1.0  
Version 1.0 of the OpenMRS focuses on deploying the core dashboard, allowing organizations to register survivors, start visits, admit for care and collect personal information. This limited feature set allows Maiti Nepal to get started entering information about current survivors while we continue developing future features. 

The SurvivorMIS is under active development. Version 1.x will focus on bringing data collection capabilities for the shelter and legal sections of Maiti Nepal. Each of these questionnaires will have sections specifically tailored for service providers in the legal and shelter sections with access controls limiting sections of each form to a particular team.

*Version 1.x will focus on adding groups of questionnaires for:*  
- Rape  
- Interception  
- Cross Border Trafficking  
- Internal Trafficking  
- Overseas Trafficking  
- Domestic Violence  
- Rehabilitation/Reintegration  

*Version 1.x Feature Requests:*
- Capture a field-level history  
- Questionnaire printing  
- Improved Active Visits screen allowing for filtering results by location  

v 2.0 will focus on collecting information on mobile devices from surveillance points. New forms will need to be created to begin collecting case information from the first moment of interaction with a survivor. This will likely use the xforms module to begin collecting mobile information. (Note: This is happening with [OpenSRP](https://github.com/OpenSRP))

Future Features Include:  
- Standardized reporting  
- Improved metadata sharing (in line with OpenMRS v2.3)  
- Integration of a mail server for email automation  
- Multi-factor authentication
